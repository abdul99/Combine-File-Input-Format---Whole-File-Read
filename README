This CombineFileInputFormat implementation considers default input split size
to be 128MB (changeable). Through this input format, we can control number of mappers
 by changing the input split size.
 
 When we pass a directory as input, all small files are combined to form a single input split
 and each mapper reads each split thus formed. This input format returns File path as key and one single
 file content as value which is of form <Text,Text>.
